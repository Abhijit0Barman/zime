The code snippet @zimeAi\src\pages\Homepage.jsx:9-132 is a React component that displays a table of posts fetched from an API, along with filters for searching and filtering the posts by tags.

The purpose of the code is to create a user interface that allows users to view a list of posts, search for specific posts, and filter the posts by tags.

The inputs to this component are:

The URL parameters from the browser's address bar, which determine the initial page number, search text, and selected tags.
The output of this component is a rendered webpage that displays:

A dropdown menu for selecting tags to filter the posts.
A search input field for entering text to search within the post titles and bodies.
A table displaying the posts, with columns for the title, body, and tags.
To achieve its purpose, the code follows this logic:

When the component mounts, it fetches the initial set of posts from the API based on the URL parameters.
The fetched posts are stored in the posts state variable, and pagination information is stored in the pagination state variable.
The tags and textSearch state variables are initialized based on the URL parameters.
The availableTags array is derived from the unique tags present in the fetched posts.
When the user selects tags from the dropdown menu, the handleTagsChange function updates the tags state and modifies the URL parameters accordingly.
When the user types in the search input field, the handleSearch function updates the textSearch state and modifies the URL parameters accordingly.
When the user navigates to a different page of the table, the handleViewTableChange function updates the pagination state and modifies the URL parameters accordingly.
The component renders the dropdown menu, search input field, and table based on the current state values.
Important logic flows and data transformations:

The useEffect hook is used to fetch the initial set of posts when the component mounts or when the URL parameters change.
The useEffect hook is also used to update the tags and textSearch state variables when the URL parameters change.
The availableTags array is created by flattening the tags arrays of all posts and removing duplicates using the Set data structure.
The handleTagsChange function converts the selected tags into a comma-separated string before updating the URL parameters.
The handleSearch function directly updates the URL parameters with the search text entered by the user.
The handleViewTableChange function updates the URL parameters with the new page number and page size based on the user's interaction with the table pagination controls.
The code follows a typical React pattern of managing state, handling user interactions, and rendering the user interface based on the current state. It leverages React hooks like useState, useEffect, and useSearchParams to manage the component's lifecycle and state, as well as the URL parameters for maintaining the application's state across page refreshes or navigations.
